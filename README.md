# Development Process

## Original Idea

The original idea came from a board game called [Goblet!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE6YYMn_334) which is a modified tic-tac-toe with some intresting features.
1. You can overtake another piece (if your piece is large enough).
2. You can move pieces after playing them instead of choosing a new piece
3. If either opponent has 3 in a row, you can gobble one of the 3 aligned pieces thus thwarting your opponents plan.
