## Long Form

### Original Idea

The original idea came from a board game called [Goblet!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE6YYMn_334) which is a modified tic-tac-toe with tree curious features.

**A**. You can overtake another piece (if your piece is large enough), but with two conditions: 
> 1. only if that piece is already on the board 
> 2. if the piece you want to overtake is smaller in size than yours.

**B**. You can move pieces after playing them instead of choosing a new piece.
> 1. But only one space at a time

**C**. If either opponent has 3 in a row, you can gobble one of the 3 aligned pieces thus thwarting your opponents plan.


### Step 1: Problem Solving Process

I struggle with problems I can't see, so to 

There is also the matter of programatic thinking and problem solving, which starts by championing seeking the shortest distance between two points.

Put another way, break the problem down into it's smallest, most simplest components and start there.

I've found this advice helpful in hindsight when reflecting but when I'm buried in log errors, it's a distant thought.

Here are some of the things I did to teach myself about what problem I was trying to solve.

I used my cats' names as internal logic variables.

|  Wireframes/Flow Charts | <img src="journal/images/122320-c.png" width="300px"/>  <img src="journal/images/122320-d.png" width="300px"/> | This process was somewhat illustrative of abstracted logic, but it didn't break down any of the problems I would later face nor did it prepare me well for them. |
|  Drawing out each play | <img src="journal/images/010621-a-drawing.png" width="300px"/> | To try and project what the programming challenges would be, I did what I know: I drew. I drew every play into a game, and recorded what was happening. |
