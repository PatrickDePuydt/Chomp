Initial pass: I started by trying to determine the most logical starting point.

To me a user starts with the game board. Select a square, choose to move a piece, or pace a new one.

But starting with the gameboard was problematic.

In the real game, a user starts with a piece.

However, I still fail to see how a user would know which piece to start with without first mentally selecting a space.

I still think it's bullshit.
